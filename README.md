# LottoApp

To run, set up a python virtual environment using the venv library. Once you activate your env, install each library listed in the requirements.txt file and then use the command streamlit run lotto_app.py to host on a local server. I used vs code to develop the app and I highly recommend using it as well. Finally, installing and using git bash as your integrated terminal option in VS code is definitely the play because powershell sucks.
